2.To have a visual of the cash flow and cash balance, I used a **combined chart**.
A combined charts allows stakeholders to simultaneously view the cash flow, inflows and outflows, and the resulting cash balance over time, seen by the line graph.
This gives an overal visualization of the company's liquidity position and the financial health. Helps with better decision-making.
